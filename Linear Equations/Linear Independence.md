Given a set if vectors $\{\textbf{v}_1,\textbf{v}_2,\dots,\textbf{v}_k\}$ 

They are **linearly independent** if:
$$c_1\textbf{v}_1,c_2\textbf{v}_2,\dots,c_k\textbf{v}_k = \textbf{0}$$
Only has [[Homogeneous systems|trivial solution]]. Else they are **linearly dependent**
On the flip side, if:
$$c_1\textbf{v}_1,c_2\textbf{v}_2,\dots,c_k\textbf{v}_k = \textbf{0}$$
And a [[Homogeneous systems|nontrivial solution]] ($c_1,c_2,\dots,c_k \neq \left[ \matrix{0 \\ \vdots \\ 0} \right]$) solution exists, they are **linearly dependent**. 

What is the smallest number of vectors needed in a parametric solution to a linear system?

### Vectors are dependent if:
- One of the vectors is a 0 vector.
- They are in each others [[Span]] ($cv_1 = v_2 \text{When  } c \neq \mathbf{0}$) 
# Theorems
- **More Vectors Than Elements**: The vectors must be linearly dependent as column cannot be pivotal so there are free variables
