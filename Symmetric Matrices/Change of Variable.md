>If $A$ is a symmetric matrix then there exists an orthogonal change of variable $\vec{x}=P\vec{y}$ that transforms $\vec{x}^TA\vec{x}$ to $\vec{y}^TD\vec{y}$ with no cross-product terms.

To express this idea more clearly, what we are doing is changing variables from $x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n$ to $y_1,y_2,\dots,y_n$. We will define this using equations discussed later.
