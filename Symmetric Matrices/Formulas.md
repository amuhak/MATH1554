>[!Theorem]+ The Spectral Theorem 
>An $n \times n$ symmetric matrix $A$  has the following properties,
>- All eigenvalues of $A$ are real.
>- The eigenspaces are mutually orthogonal.
>- $A$ can be diagonalized as $A=PDP^T$, where $D$ is diagonal and $P$ is orthogonal.

***
>[!Theorem]+ Non-Negative Eigenvalues
>The eigenvalues of $A^TA$ are non-negative.
